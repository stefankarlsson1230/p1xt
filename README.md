## Tier 1 - Web Development Foundation

### Goal
The goal of Tier 1 is to gain a robust foundational knowledge of web development and become confident at coding beginner to intermediate-level web projects. It should provide a stepping stone for branching into other facets of development or for diving deeper into more advanced web development.

### Instructions:
- Proceed through the projects alongside the Odin Project so that you are always practicing by building a project on Frontend Mentor while you progress through Odin.
- When you begin working on the Frontend Mentor projects, sign up for their discord and engage with the community. Help others when you can.
- Include mathematics in your studies if possible. There is a General Mathematics Progression at the bottom of the [Notes](#notes) below to guide you to whatever course in the sequence is appropriate for your level.
- Leverage the reading material listed for this tier while completing the projects. It covers the materials from the courses in much greater depth and will help a lot. You should be familiar with both reading it and using it as a reference when you have questions by the end of the tier.
- Near the end of this tier, polish up two of your best projects, showcasing your best work, for potential leverage in creating your portfolio in Tier 4.

<a name="tier-3-interview-prep"></a>
## Tier 3 - Interview Prep

### Goal
The goal of Tier 3 is to gain skills that will serve you well as you begin a job search. This tier dives deep into data structures and algorithms which will not only help in interviews but will also teach you to create efficient code that will work well on the job. The programming language used for this tier is Java and that choice is intentional as familiarity with a more structured language will inform how you program in whichever language you might be using in the future. 

### Instructions:
- Proceed through the courses in order
- Always be practicing. Ideas for practice:
  - Challenges on [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/training) in Java. Note that, for the first time, CodinGame also shows up in the activities below. You should aim to have finished 100 challenges on CodinGame from a mix of difficulty levels before completing this tier.
  - Math progression on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math). This is the tier where you'll really notice it if you haven't been building up your math skill - often, understanding an algorithm is more about understanding how it works logically (mathematically) than knowing how to program it.
  - [Ask ChatGPT to assign you a programming challenge](./RequestingChallengesFromAI.md) 
- Take time to read from the reading list
- Near the end of this tier, polish up two of your best projects, showcasing your best work, for potential leverage in creating your portfolio in Tier 4.

## Tier 4 - Develop a Portfolio

### Goal
The goal of Tier 4 is to polish a portfolio of your best work.

### Instructions:
- Create an online portfolio of your best work. You can:
  - Polish projects you've completed previously
  - Complete new projects
- Ensure the portfolio is visible online
- Ensure that you've adhered to good coding practices
- Ensure that your projects are clean and free from errors
- Aim for between 5 and 10 projects and ensure at least two projects are substantial in size and scope
- If you intend to dive deeper into React or Angular in Tier 5, you may choose to include a few less projects at this point, knowing that you will be adding a few more in that tier.
- If you need project ideas, ask ChatGPT using very specific prompts for project ideas of the scope you need and using the skills and technologies you'd like to highlight

## Tier 5 - Dive Deeper

### Goal
The goal of Tier 5 is to enhance your knowledge and abilities by deep diving into areas of particular interest to you. Select one or more focus areas as your interests dictate.

**Select any area that interests you for further study:**

### Tier 5 - Focus Area - React

You will notice that the resources listed here for React are not courses,YouTube playlists, or podcasts where other people teach you React. This section lists the official docs. This is because:
- by this point you should be capable of, and consistently, "reading the docs"
- React changes pretty regularly, tutorials won't be updated, the docs will.
- The docs are actually fantastic and you will learn far more by diving in, as any course or tutorial would only show you bits and pieces, and to be an expert, you need a much bigger picture.

#### Instructions:
- Thoroughly study each resource. Dive deep into the APIs and documentation after working through any tutorials and quickstarts.
- Always be practicing. Ideas for practice:
  - Projects on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?sort=difficulty%7Casc&type=free) in React
  - Math progression on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math)
  - [Ask ChatGPT to assign you a programming challenge](./RequestingChallengesFromAI.md)
  - Complete four significantly complex practice projects in React. You will want them for your portfolio so make sure they demonstrate the best of your abilities. (Ask ChatGPT for project ideas if you don't have specific projects in mind that you'd like to focus on.)

### Tier 5 - Focus Area - Mathematics

Note: For this Focus Area, feel free to dive into it in its entirety, or just do a course or two here and there to supplement one of the other focus areas. You will notice that if you start working through the Computer Science Focus Area, from time to time, one of the Mathematics courses from this Focus Area will be listed as a pre-requisite.
| Courses                                                                                                                               | Status | Evidence |

### Tier 5 - Focus Area - Computer Science

Note: This focus area dives a bit deeper into nitty-gritty computer science topics. Feel free to jump around and take whichever courses sound most interesting to you. (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs is one of my favorites.) You will, at times, find that a course has a mathematics course pre-requisite - those courses may be found in the Mathematics Focus Area above.
